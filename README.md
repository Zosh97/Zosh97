### ðŸŒŠ About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Zohre, a beginner coder exploring the exciting worlds of Python. With a good background in linguistics, I discovered my passion for Natural Language Processing (NLP) about a year ago and have been diving deeper into this fascinating field ever since.

### ðŸ“š Background

I hold a degree in linguistics, which has provided me with a unique perspective on language. Over the past year, I've been self-studying NLP, working on small projects, and continuously improving my skills.

### ðŸ¤– Interests

I'm deeply curious about robots and artificial intelligence, and how they can be integrated with human language. My goal is to combine my linguistic knowledge with technical skills to contribute to innovative AI projects or any other Internship/Apprenticeship project.

### ðŸš€ Goals

My current objective is to enhance my IT skills and become proficient in Python. I'm particularly interested in collaborating on open-source NLP projects and learning from the amazing developer community here on GitHub.

### ðŸŽ‰ Fun Fact

Fun fact about me: I can understand and speak three languages fluently! This multilingual ability often comes in handy when exploring different linguistic datasets in NLP; however, sometimes you wonder which language you are talking in!

### ðŸ“© Contact

Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration or just to chat about AI, NLP, and anything tech-related.
